## Project Description
This project demonstrates **method overloading** in Java.  

### What the Project Does
The program prints personalized form letters by using overloaded methods to display different salutations. It also prints a thank-you message after each salutation.  

### Programming Concepts Used
- **Method overloading** (two methods with the same name but different parameters).  
- **Static methods** used inside the main class.  
- **String concatenation** to generate dynamic text.  
- **System.out.println** for console output.  

### Expected Inputs
- The program does not ask for user input. Instead, sample names are hardcoded into the program (`Kelly` and `Christy Johnson`).  

### Expected Outputs
Dear Mr. or Ms. Kelly,
Thank you for your recent order.

Dear Christy Johnson,
Thank you for your recent order.
